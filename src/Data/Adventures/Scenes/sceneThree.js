        "After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site. The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins. The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party’s marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.",

            title: "Snare",
            content: "About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare’s cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn’t carefully lowered down takes ld6 bludgeoning damage from the fall."

            content: "Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn’t detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage. The pit’s walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out."
