        "You’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.",

            title: "Goblin Combat",
            content: "Review the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you’ll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party can- not surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. Roll a d20, add the goblins’ Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins’ check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see “Surprise” in the rulebook). Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of every- one’s initiative count in the margins of this book or on a separate piece of paper. When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins’ stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 2, “Combat,” in the rulebook. When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail."
